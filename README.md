# Home Climate Monitoring and Control System

This project uses an ESP8266 D1 Mini to create a home climate monitoring and control system. It collects temperature and humidity data using a DHT22 sensor, sends this data to an MQTT broker for integration into a smart home system, and provides access to the data through a web interface. 

## Features

- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring.
- Data transmission to an MQTT broker for use in smart home applications.
- Access to climate data through a user-friendly web interface.
- Over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates for easy maintenance.

## Usage

1. Set up the ESP8266 D1 Mini with the necessary components.
2. Flash the firmware to the device.
3. Put your credentials for WIFI and MQTT networks
4. Connect to the device's Wi-Fi network.
5. Access the web interface to view climate data or make configuration changes.
6. Integrate the MQTT data into your smart home system.
